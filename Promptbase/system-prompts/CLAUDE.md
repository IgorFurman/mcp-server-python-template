# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a documentation repository containing leaked system prompts from various LLM-based services. The repository serves as a collection of AI system prompts for research and educational purposes, with contributions verified through reproducible sources.

## Repository Structure

- **Root directory**: Contains markdown files with system prompts from different AI services
- **images/**: Contains image files referenced by some prompt documents
- **File naming convention**: `service-name_model_YYYYMMDD.md` format for system prompt files

## Key Guidelines

### Content Standards
- All system prompt files must include verifiable sources or reproducible prompts
- Files should follow the established naming convention with service name, model, and date
- Commercial source code should not be included to prevent DMCA takedown requests
- Each file should include source attribution at the top

### File Format
System prompt files typically follow this structure:
1. Title with service and date
2. Source citation
3. System prompt content (often in "System Prompt" section)
4. Additional context or examples as needed

### Contributing
- PRs should match the format of existing documents
- Include verifiable sources that can be confirmed
- Alternative: Post links in Issues for verification and merge by maintainers
- Repository is cited in academic papers, so accuracy is important

## Development Commands

This is a documentation-only repository with no build, test, or development commands. Changes are made directly to markdown files and committed to git.

## Common Tasks

- **Adding new system prompts**: Create new `.md` file following naming convention
- **Updating existing prompts**: Edit the relevant `.md` file with source verification
- **Reviewing submissions**: Verify sources and reproducibility before merging

## Important Notes

- This repository contains system prompts for research/educational purposes only
- Content should be used for understanding AI system behavior, not for malicious purposes
- Always verify sources when referencing these prompts in research or documentation
