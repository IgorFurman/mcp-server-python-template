# 🚀 Supabase Setup Guide

Your Supabase connection is configured and ready! Follow these steps to complete the setup.

## ✅ Step 1: Database Schema (REQUIRED)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mvajognrlmunncwvelwn
2. **Navigate to**: SQL Editor (in the left sidebar)
3. **Copy and paste** the contents of `supabase/schema.sql` 
4. **Click "Run"** to create all tables and functions

## ✅ Step 2: Add Service Role Key (REQUIRED for sync)

1. **In Supabase Dashboard**: Go to Settings > API
2. **Copy your `service_role` key** (NOT the anon key you already have)
3. **Add it to your `.env` file**:

```bash
# Add this line to your .env file
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

## ✅ Step 3: Sync Your Data

After completing steps 1 & 2, run:

```bash
# Sync all your CSV files to Supabase
npm run sync

# Or sync individual files
npm run sync:prompts    # prompts.csv → database
npm run sync:vibe      # vibeprompts.csv → database  
npm run sync:system    # base/*.md files → database
```

## ✅ Step 4: Test Everything

```bash
# Test the connection
node test-connection.js

# Test a query
npm run test:connection
```

## 🎯 What You Get

After setup, you'll have:

- **🗄️ Full database** with all your prompts, system prompts, and app ideas
- **🔍 Advanced search** across all content types
- **👥 User authentication** (signup/login)
- **❤️ User favorites** and collections
- **📊 Analytics** and trending algorithms
- **⚡ Real-time updates** for collaborative features

## 🔧 Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run sync              # Sync all data
npm run sync:dry-run     # Preview sync without changes
node test-connection.js   # Test connection

# Production ready APIs
import { promptsAPI } from './supabase/prompts.js'
import { authManager } from './supabase/auth.js'
```

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Connection issues**: Check your `.env` file has the correct URL and keys
- **Schema errors**: Make sure you ran the entire `schema.sql` file
- **Sync fails**: Ensure you have the `service_role` key in `.env`
- **More info**: Check `supabase/README.md` for detailed documentation

## 🔐 Security Note

Your credentials are now stored in `.env` - make sure this file is in your `.gitignore` to keep them private!
