# Docker Deployment Success âœ…

## Summary
Your MCP Sequential Think Server has been successfully containerized and is ready for deployment!

## What Was Accomplished
- âœ… Created development Dockerfile with Python 3.12
- âœ… Created production-optimized Dockerfile  
- âœ… Set up docker-compose for both dev and production
- âœ… Added convenience shell scripts for building and running
- âœ… Successfully built Docker image: `mcp-sequential-think:latest`
- âœ… Tested container startup - server runs correctly on port 7071

## Quick Start Commands

### Development Mode
```bash
# Build the image
./build.sh

# Run in development mode
./run-dev.sh

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up dev
```

### Production Mode
```bash
# Build production image
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t mcp-sequential-think:prod .

# Run production container
./run-prod.sh

# Or use docker-compose
docker-compose up prod
```

## Container Details
- **Image**: `mcp-sequential-think:latest`
- **Base**: Python 3.12-slim
- **Default Port**: 7071 (SSE mode)
- **User**: Non-root user for security
- **Database**: SQLite with persistent storage

## Available Transport Modes
1. **SSE Mode** (HTTP): `--transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7071`
2. **STDIO Mode**: `--transport stdio` (for direct MCP client connection)

## Testing the Container
```bash
# Test SSE mode (HTTP)
docker run --rm -p 7071:7071 mcp-sequential-think \
  python sequential_think_server.py --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7071

# Test STDIO mode  
docker run --rm -it mcp-sequential-think \
  python sequential_think_server.py --transport stdio
```

## Next Steps
Your MCP server is now fully containerized and ready for:
- Local development with Docker
- Cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline integration

The containerization setup is complete and functional! ðŸŽ‰
