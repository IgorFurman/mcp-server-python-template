```

#### Framework Application:
- **Problem-Solving Framework**: For systematic component breakdown
- **Analysis Framework**: For identifying patterns and relationships
- **Decision-Making Framework**: For choosing optimal refactoring strategies

### Implementation Plan:
1. Use `enhance_prompt()` tool on existing component analysis requests
2. Apply `get_framework_guidance("component refactoring")` for structured approach
3. Store successful refactoring patterns in prompt database for reuse

## 2. Onboarding Flow User Experience Enhancement

### Current Challenge
